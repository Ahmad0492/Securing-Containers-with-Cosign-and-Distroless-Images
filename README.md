# Securing-Containers-with-Cosign-and-Distroless-Images
Any container-based architecture must include security measures for container deployments. To help increase container security, a variety of technologies and methods are available, including Cosign and Distroless images.
We’ll go over how to secure containers using Cosign and Distroless images in this article, along with the commands and code that are required to carry out these tasks.
# What is Cosign?

Cosign is an open-source tool for container image signing and verification. It enables users to sign and verify container images, providing an extra layer of security by ensuring that only trusted images are deployed.

To get started with Cosign, you’ll need to install it on your system. You can do this using the following command:

`curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sigstore/cosign/main/install.sh | sudo bash`

Once Cosign is installed, you can sign your container images using the following command:

`cosign sign -key cosign.key <image>`

As a result, the image will produce a signature that will be saved as an annotation in the image manifest.

You can use the next command to check a container image’s signature:

`cosign verify <image>`

This will confirm that the image has not been tampered with by comparing the signature to the signer’s public key.

# What are Distroless images?

The term “distroless images” refers to container images that only include the application and its runtime dependencies, and no other programmers or hardware. Because there are fewer attack surfaces for potential attackers, they are more secure as a result.

You can use Distroless images by writing a Dockerfile that makes use of a Distroless image as the application’s base image. An illustration Dockerfile for a basic Python Flask application is provided here:

```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian10   
WORKDIR /app  
COPY requirements.txt .  
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt  
COPY app.py .  
CMD [ "python3", "app.py" ]
```

The basic image for our application in this Dockerfile is the gcr.io/distroless/python3-debian10 image. Also, we are installing the necessary dependencies with pip3 and copying the requirements.txt file. Lastly, we are transferring the app.py file and designating it as the container’s entry point.

It’s crucial to just include the application’s runtime dependencies when utilising Distroless images. Your container will be more secure as a result of having a smaller attack surface.

# Significance of Container Security
Securing containers with Cosign and Distroless images is important for several reasons:

## 1. Preventing supply chain attacks
When an attacker tries to undermine the integrity of an image during its generation, distribution, or deployment, container images can be a great target. Only trusted images can be deployed in your environment if you use Cosign to sign and validate container images.

## 2. Reducing attack surface
Unlike container images, distroless images merely include the application and its runtime requirements. You can lessen the attack surface of your containerized apps by deleting unused system-level components.

## 3. Compliance requirements
You can be subject to compliance requirements that demand the use of signed and validated container images depending on the sector you work in. You can make sure you’re fulfilling these standards by using Cosign and Distroless images.

## 4. Enhancing security posture:
You may improve your organization’s security posture and lower the risk of data breaches and other security incidents by securing your container images with Cosign and Distroless images.

In general, using Cosign and Distroless images to secure containers is a crucial step in guaranteeing the security and integrity of your containerized applications.

# Here’s a simple example
## 1. Create a Distroless Docker File

Make a Dockerfile that uses a Distroless base image for your application. For instance:
```
FROM gcr.io/distroless/base
COPY myapp /
CMD ["/myapp"]
```

## 2. Build the Docker Image

Using the Dockerfile you just made, generate the Docker image for your application. For instance:

`docker build -t myapp .`
## 3. Sign the Docker image

Use Cosign to sign the Docker image you just built. For example:

`cosign sign -key cosign.key myapp`
## 4. Verify the signature

Verify the signature of the Docker image using Cosign. For example:

`cosign verify myapp`
If the verification succeeds, you should see a message that says “Verified by: my-signer@example.com”.

## 5. Push the signed Docker image

Push the signed Docker image to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry. For example:

`docker push myregistry/myapp:latest`
Lastly, Ensure that only trusted images are deployed in your environment.

# Issues Encountered when Securing Containers

Here are some common issues you may encounter when securing containers with Cosign and Distroless images:

## 1. Invalid signatures
Receiving a “invalid signature” error is one of the most frequent problems when utilising Cosign to sign and validate container images. This may occur if the picture has been altered since it was signed, the signer’s key is unreliable, or there is an issue with the signing procedure itself.

## 2. Dependency compatibility
Utilizing Distroless images may occasionally cause compatibility problems with the requirements of your application. You must make sure that your application’s dependencies are included in the container image or are being fetched in through a package manager because distroless images do not include any system-level requirements.

## 3. Key management
It might be difficult to manage private keys when several people or teams are working together to sign documents. Ensure sure you have a method for creating and keeping private keys that is safe, as well as one for revoking them if they are compromised.

## 4. Image size
Disstroless photos are typically smaller than conventional container images, however if you have a lot of photographs to manage, the size may still be an issue. Make sure you have a procedure in place for reducing the size of your container images.

## 5. Complexity
Your deployment procedure may get more complicated if you use Distroless images and sign and validate container images with Cosign.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, modern software development must take security of containerized systems seriously. The attack surface of your application can be reduced by using distroless images, and your overall security posture can be improved by signing and certifying container images with Cosign. it’s well worth the effort to ensure that your containerized applications are secure and reliable.
